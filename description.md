#Assignment Title: React-based E-commerce Website

##Objective:
To create a modern e-commerce website using React, Redux, and other popular packages that can be used in a real-life production environment. The project should cover the concepts of functional component hooks, context, and performance optimization techniques.

##Subtasks:

    -Project Setup
        Create a new React project using a modern build tool like Create React App.
        Set up Redux and React-Redux for state management.
        Install and configure additional packages like React-Router-DOM, Axios, and Styled Components.
    -UI Design
        Create a UI design for an e-commerce website that can be used on desktop and mobile devices.
        Separate the UI into reusable components and implement the design using Styled Components.
        Use React-Router-DOM to create a multi-page website with a home page, product pages, and a cart page.
    -Data Management
        Fetch product data from a public API using Axios and display the products on the website.
        Implement a cart feature that allows users to add and remove products to/from their cart.
        Use Redux to manage the cart state across different components.
    -Performance Optimization
        Analyze the website's performance using modern tools like Lighthouse, Webpack Bundle Analyzer, and React DevTools.
        Use performance optimization techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization to optimize the website's performance.
    -Bonus Features
        Implement additional features like product search, product filtering, or a checkout process.
        Use React Context to manage UI-related state like theme or language.

Here are some additional tasks that can be added to the assignment to cover these features:

    -User Authentication
        Implement user authentication using a third-party provider like Firebase Authentication or Auth0.
        Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
        Use Redux to manage the user state across different components.

    -Server-side Integration
        Implement server-side integration to store user data and purchases.
        Create a backend API using a popular framework like Express or Django.
        Use Axios to make HTTP requests to the API and handle responses in the frontend.

    -Payment Integration
        Integrate a third-party payment provider like Stripe or PayPal to allow users to make payments.
        Use Redux to manage the payment state and handle payment errors.

These tasks will require the students to integrate additional tools and techniques to create a fully-functional e-commerce website. They will also cover important aspects of modern web development like user authentication, server-side integration, and payment processing. The grading criteria should be adjusted accordingly to reflect these additional tasks.




##Deliverables:
The final project should be a fully-functional e-commerce website that can be run locally or deployed to a production environment. The student should submit the project's source code and a brief report that explains their design decisions and performance optimization techniques.

##Grading Criteria:
The project will be graded based on the following criteria:

    -UI Design: How well the student has implemented the UI design and separated it into reusable components.
    -Data Management: How well the student has implemented the cart feature and used Redux to manage the cart state.
    -Performance Optimization: How well the student has optimized the website's performance using modern techniques.
    -Bonus Features: How many additional features the student has implemented and how well they have used React Context to manage UI-related state.
    -Code Quality: How well the student has organized and documented their source code.
    -Presentation: How well the student has presented their design decisions and performance optimization techniques in the report.
